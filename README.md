# Login-Web-App
(2022) This is a Login Web App prototype that I decided to upload. This will allow the user to create an account or login using a username and password that is saved in txt file. The web app is still under development and is merely a project meant for fun. It is currently built with HTML, CSS, and Python.

Note(I currently have styling in the html pages and that is not something I normally do. This project was an exception however.)
